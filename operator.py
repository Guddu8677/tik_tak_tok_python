#Operator in python
#operator are used to perform operation on variables and values python has
#the following operators
#1 Airthmetic operators
#2 Comparison operators
#3 Logical operators
#4 Bitwise operators
#5 Assingment operator
#6 ldentity operator
#7 Membership operator


#1Airthmetic operator


x=int(input("first nubmer"))
y=int(input("second nubmer"))
print(x+y)


print(x-y)
print(x*y)
print(x/y)
print(x%y)
print(x**y)#power
print(x // y) # integer division




#2 Comparision operator

print(x>y)
print(x<y)
print(x==y)
print(x>=y)
print(x<=y)
print(x !=y)


#3 Logical operator and , or, not
x=True
y =False
print(x or y)
print(x and y)
print(not y)


#4 Bitwise operator it first convert into binary after that perform operation
x=2
y=3
print(x & y)
print(x | y)
print( x << 2)
print(y >>3)
print(~x)



#Assingmet operato vale assing in variable
a=4
print(a)
a+=3
print(a)


#identifer  it tell two thing is on the smave memory location or not
a=3
b=3
print(a is b)




#Membership operator it tell that thing in that  or not like
name="Guddu"
print("d" in name)
print("d" not in name)
